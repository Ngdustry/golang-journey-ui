This repo houses the WIP front end React application for the `Journey` project; a full stack 'To Do' app using `React` with `Typescript` and `Go`.

It interacts with the [back end](https://github.com/Ngdustry/golang-journey-api) to fetch and persist data in a `PostregreSQL` database.

This project is currently `deployed` on [Netlify](https://nervous-lamarr-156506.netlify.app/).
