# **React Front End** [WIP]

This directory houses the front end React application, which is currently WIP.

It currently can interact with the back end (written in Go and WIP) to fetch and persist data in a database.

Currently in this project directory, you can run locally:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
